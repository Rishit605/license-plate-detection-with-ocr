# V-RegX
V-RegX is a web application that allows users to upload an image/video and get detect the vehicalas well as the number plate of the veicla and using the detections, it analyses the number plate to extract the characters of the number plate. It is an application that allows users to perfom object detection on their image and get the vehical details with just one click and th data is save in a tabular format for users' convience to use the data later.

## Features
